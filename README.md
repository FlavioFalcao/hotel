Hotel Advisor

You are in the 2000 year. The Internet is very poor developed. There are no booking and social

services. And you have a great idea... You should develop a prototype of the application, where

users can add a hotels which they have visited and put а rating for them.

Lets start with this simple workflow

1. As a user I can register. As a user I can sign in.

2. As a user I can see a list of hotels.

3. As a user I can add a hotel. Hotel has next attributes:

g. address(different object) ­ country, state,  city, street

4. As a user on hotel details page I can rate a hotel from 1 to 5 with comment.

5. On the landing page display top 5 hotels with the best rating.

If you know your way, skip this step.

Otherwise we are expecting from you to use these gems in project ­ devise, twitter bootstrap,

haml, simple_form, carriervawe, rspec, capybara
